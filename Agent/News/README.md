# Project Hyean (慧眼) - Automated Economic News Analysis

## Overview
**Project Hyean** analyzes South Korean economic news and assesses its potential impact on the economy. The goal is to provide quick, concise, and informative posts based on the analysis results. These insights are delivered in the form of comments for easy consumption by the public. This project is designed for demo and testing purposes; please refrain from any misuse.

## Automation for Web Integration
If you need automation for different types of websites, simply inherit the `NewsService` class and implement it accordingly. The `leave_comment` function, which is responsible for posting comments, can be customized with various APIs or UI-based automation without deviating from the core structure.

For applications like **vllm**, it can be integrated by inheriting the `llm_service` class and implementing it in line with the defined protocols.

## Directory Structure
- The **gguf model** is located in the `ai` folder.  
- To adjust various settings, modify them in the `main` configuration file.

## Logging
There are two types of logs generated by the program:

1. **`result.json`** – Contains the summary of the article and the details of the content posted.
2. **`log.json`** – Logs related to the program's operation, including its activities and status.

Please refer to these files for troubleshooting and tracking purposes.

## Prompts
The program is designed around two primary prompts:

1. **Summary Prompt**  
   This prompt is used to generate a summary of a given article. Example:

   ```json
   {
       "summary_prompt": "<|im_start|>system\nPlease summarize the following article.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\n{content}\n---\nPlease summarize the above content in 300 characters.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n"
   }
   ```

2. **Reply Prompt**  
   This prompt is used to generate an economic analysis comment based on the summary. Example:

   ```json
   {
       "reply_prompt": "<|im_start|>system\nBased on the summary, write a comment analyzing its relevance to the South Korean economy.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nSummary: {summary}\n---\nWrite an economic analysis comment based on the above summary.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n"
   }
   ```

## Authentication & User Interaction
The program does **not** automate the site authentication process (such as CAPTCHA). Therefore, a 30-second manual user authentication time is required before the program begins operating. Please keep this in mind while using the tool.
